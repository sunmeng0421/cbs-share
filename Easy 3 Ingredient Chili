Ingredients

*1 can of chili beans (undrained)

*1 can of chili ready diced tomatoes ( I use Hunts Seasoned Diced Tomato Sauce for Chili)

Directions:

Mix the meat, beans and tomatoes together in large pot, bring it to a boil and then simmer for about 30 minutes. 

You could also combine in a crock pot and cook on low for 4-6 hours.

Enjoy topped with cheese and sour cream.
