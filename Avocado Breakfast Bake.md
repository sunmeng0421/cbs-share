Ingredients


*2 large avocados

*4 eggs

*4 strips of bacon

*salt and pepper to taste

Instructions

1. First, fry up your bacon. Once thoroughly cooked and cooled, crumble into pieces and set aside.

2. Cut avocados in half and remove the pit. You'll also want to scoop out a bit extra of the avocado to give the eggs room to sit.

3. Crack an egg into the center of each half of the avocados.

4. Top each one with one piece of crumbled bacon, salt, and pepper.

5. Cook in a baking dish in the oven set to 400 degrees for about 15 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked to your desired doneness.

Enjoy! Yum!
